QA Automation Testing using Selenium for ProQuest
 
I am using Selemium framework as an Open-source functional automation testing tool for the test cases.

The process of installing Selenium involves 3 steps:
1.	Install Java
2.	Install Eclipse IDE
3.	Install Selenium WebDriver

For complete instructions to install all automation components, please follow the following doc: 
[install instructions](https://github.com/sabiha39/proquestQA/blob/master/Document%20complete%20instructions%20to%20install%20all%20automation%20components.docx)

### Selenium Architecture
Selenium has a client-server architecture, and includes both client and server components.

Selenium Client includes:
•	The WebDriver API, which you use to develop test scripts to interact with page and application elements
•	The RemoteWebDriver class, which communicates with a remote Selenium server

Selenium Server includes:
•	A server component, to receive requests from Selenium Client 's RemoteWebDriver class
•	The WebDriver API, to run tests against web browsers on a server machine
•	Selenium Grid, implemented by Selenium Server in command-line options for grid features, including a central hub and nodes for various environments and desired browser capabilities

There are seven basic elements of a Selenium test script, which apply to any test case and any application under test (AUT):

1.	Create a WebDriver instance.
2.	Navigate to a Web page.
3.	Locate an HTML element on the Web page.
4.	Perform an action on an HTML element.
5.	Anticipate the browser response to the action.
6.	Run tests and record test results using a test framework.
7.	Conclude the test.
